## Principles

1. Write clear and specific intructions
2. Give time to model think.

    - Specify the steps to complete a task
    - Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion  
    (Giving time to model doesn't mean asking it to wait 10s to answer, for exemple. Give time to the model is more like being very detaield on the question for the model read, start to recognize the challenge and then start answering.)

## Limitations
1. Hallucination
